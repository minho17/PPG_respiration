# PPG_respiration
This code is provided to reproduce the operation of the proposed framework described in the paper, "Deep Learning-Based Ensemble Framework for Estimating Respiration Rate from PPG".
The provided package includes pretrained models required to evaluate data from a subset of subjects in the BIDMC database, allowing users to run the proposed framework and verify its performance.

1. Testing method
- make_data1.m : preprocessing the data into a format compatible with the proposed framework (the CapnoBase or BIDMC dataset must be acquired in advance to run this code)
- test.py : code for running the proposed framework

2. Performance verification
'result.txt' file shows the simulation result as below:
